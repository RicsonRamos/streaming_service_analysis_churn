# CI Pipeline: Quality Assurance, Automated Testing, and Docker Validation
# ==============================================================================
# This workflow orchestrates the Continuous Integration (CI) process for the 
# Churn Radar project. It ensures code quality via Linting, execution of unit 
# tests via Pytest, and verifies that the Docker image builds successfully.
